                <p>I was born and lived in Vietnam for about 13 years. In 2008, my family decided to moved to the United States. It was an excited moment of my life, also a culture shock for me since I barely knew any English. So, I spent the first two years learning English. I graduted from Lincoln High School and got accepted into UCR in 2015. As you can see from the picture, I graduted college with a B.A in Business Economics.</p>
                <p>I have been looking for jobs since graduation but it was a challenge. So I decided to join coding bootcamp at UCB Extension with the hope to increase job opportunities.</p>
